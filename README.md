Understanding user needs means listening to feedback, analyzing problems, and turning those into clear, actionable tasks. User stories help by breaking down these needs into simple goals. This keeps development focused on real user problems and ensures features are useful.

When developing programs, I follow an iterative, Agile approach, focusing on small improvements over time. I like using Sprint Planning to set clear goals, Daily Standups to track progress, and Sprint Reviews to learn from past work. I also value Test-Driven Development (TDD) for writing reliable code and CI/CD pipelines for automating testing and deployment. These practices help create flexible, user-friendly software.

Being a good team member means communicating well, collaborating, and staying accountable. I try to explain ideas clearly, give and receive feedback, and support my teammates when needed. Reliability and adaptability are also keyâ€”meeting deadlines, staying open to learning, and keeping up with new tech. Most importantly, a positive attitude and respect for others help create a strong, productive team.
